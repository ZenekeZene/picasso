# Picasso

<img src="./static/logo.jpg"/>

This is a repository to paint things, using a canvas.

It has been inspired by the work of the magnificent [Magoz](https://magoz.studio/#selected-work) (*).

It is designed to be implemented on my own portfolio, but you can fork it and use wherever you want.

Among other things, it has the following...

## You can

- Paint (really?)
- Use colors
- Undo (Cmd+Z included)
- Replay the painting
- Download as png.
- Clean the full canvas.

## TO DO
- [ ] Redo action.
- [ ] Cypress coverage E2E.
- [ ] Time machine with range slider.
- [ ] Cloud drawings (Firebase).
- [ ] Collaboration (?).

## To install
```
nvm use
```
Note: If you use NVM. If not, the node version is in .nvmrc file. Be careful.

```
npm install
```

## To launch

```
npm run dev
```
